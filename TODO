[X] Remove creative mod, give_initial_stuff

*   Remove checks for singleplayer, damage, etc

*   Poisen function really should kill at <1 hp

[X] Poisen hud icon is bread, but needs to be drumstick

*   Last I knew, cotton broke on minerals

*   Cotton is string, and should be renamed.  Cotton, apparently, has med-
    icinal purposes.

*   FIX itemdrop (haha, dropping results in insta-pickup) -- Still needs
    sound plop on click-pickup.

*   Nametag should send text fields on enter key press.  Currently, pressing
    the "Proceed" button is required in order to have an effect.

*   Backpack from Kalite.

*   Axe crafts in either direction

[X] Fix hard clay groups.

*   Verify all other groups.

*   Right clicking with some craftitems doesn't looks for def at pointed thing.

[X] Find the hidden goodies (papyrus, cotton, etc) in dungeon loot and ruins

*   Cactus, desert stone? ... (Whatever items pre-exist in source files.)

*   Walls are group stone=1, and this I can probably not remove, as I am lead
    to believe that this is required for NDT_CONNECTED
    However, I now notice that its group is actually stone=2, so it is
    possible that this could be adjusted in, for example, the furnace
    recipe?  Or not, because recipes use only group:item, and not a rating.
    [Move to BUGS?]

*   Flush out unused assets, like hud_new.png used by the item wheel hud.

[X] Check wieldhand.png, it appears the wrong one is being used.

*   Ensure no duplicate textures exist, or are overriding one another.
